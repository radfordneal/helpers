The example programs in this directory demonstrate how to write
programs that use the helpers facility, and can be used to test what
performance gains are achievable.  The programs are documented in
examples-doc.

The "example" program takes many options that can be used to exercise
various features.  

The program "simple" is a simplified version of this example, which is
a better place to start looking.

The program "parex" is another version that demonstrates how a single
vector computation can be parallelized.

All the programs are compiled with "make".  The Makefile provided is
set up to use gcc, but it can be modified to use a different compiler.
(Options suitable for a SPARC system not using gcc are in the Makefile
but disabled.)  The program "example-d" is "example" compiled with
helpers disabled.  The program "example-m" is "example" compiled with
multithreading disabled.

The shell file "doit" runs "example" and "parex" with various numbers
of helpers, with and without pipelining.
